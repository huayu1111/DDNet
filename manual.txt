* A usage guideline for KDDANet tool

1. Installation
The package can be run after unzipping without installation on either Windows or Linux system as long as Perl has been installed.
2. Running
Command: perl KDDANet.pl -dr A tab-delimited text file gives drug info -di A tab-delimited text file gives disease info -n A tab-delimited text file gives gene interactome network info -dt A tab-delimited txt file gives drug target info -dg  --dd /share/home/zhangjin/project_pharpath/PNet/Data/GSPs_Gastrointestinal.txt -o /share/home/zhangjin/project_pharpath/PNet/Result/SDrTDi/Gastrointestinal_Disease -gmin 7 -gmax 12 -gstep 1 -opt SDrTDi -h

-s  FILE_SOURCE for source nodes [required]
-t  FILE_TARGET for target(sink) nodes [required]
-e  FILE_EDGE for network edges (default a weighted human interactome './Data/edges.txt' described in Huang et al. 2011)
-o  DIRECTORY_OUT for output files (default './Result/')
-min  GAMMA_MIN	(default 4)
-max  GAMMA_MAX	(default 10)
-step  GAMMA_INCREMENT (default 0.05)
-h  help
3. Files format
(1)FILE_SOURCE/FILE_TARGET
A tab-delimited text file provides source/target nodes information
Format: nodeID nodeWeight
Example:     635	1
(2)FILE_EDGE
A tab-delimited text file provides Network information
Format: From	To	Type	Weight
Example:     2		5340	->	0.013326773023727	
"->" for directed edge, "--" for undirected edge
(3)node.RankByGamma
Each genes was assigned a minimal parameter γ when it first appears in an optimal subnetwork, together with its node type (V1 for source nodes, V2 for sink nodes and PR for predicted genes connecting the source and sink nodes)
Format: nodeID nodeMinGamma nodeType (tab-delimited)
Example:2	6	V1
(4)subnetwork files
The package generates a series of subnetworks within the designated value range of parameter γ (between the input min and max values) at the input step value. The output file (.sif) and annotation files (.NODE and .EDGE) can be loaded directly into Cytoscape for network visualization.
4. Test dataset
The test dataset in ./Data/ is the data we described in the paper (with the differentially expressed genes in muscle as sink nodes).
